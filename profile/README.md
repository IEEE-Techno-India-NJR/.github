Great, Rohit! 🚀 Since you want a **README** for your IEEE Student Branch organization (with your current members list, some roles filled, some blank), I’ll create a clean, professional, GitHub-style README that you can later update when missing details are filled. I’ll also align it with the tone of your **IEEE-Student-Branch-First-Event** document.

Here’s a draft:
